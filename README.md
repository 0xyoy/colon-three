# :3
the official repository of the :3 programming language

the basis of the interpreter is https://github.com/pocmo/Python-Brainfuck thank you very much

THIS IS DEPENDENT ON GETCH:
`
pip install getch
`

because the code i forked this from has a broken implementation of getch() on mac os

this is literally just brainfuck but with keywords changed:

- \> becomes :3
- \< becomes :c
- \+ becomes :33
- \- becomes :cc
- \, becomes :333  
- \. becomes :ccc
- \[ becomes :3333
- \] becomes :cccc
